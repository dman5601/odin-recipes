# odin-recipes

This project will test my knowledge of creating a basic webpage from HTML as learned in The Odin Project. 
TOP has shown how to create a repo, clone to my system, edit and create to push back to Git Hub. 

This project will be simple as it is my first one completed thru TOP. 

A brief summary;

Iteration 1: initial structure
Iteration 2: recipe page
Iteration 3: recipe page content
Iteration 4: add more recipes

All of this will be done using html
